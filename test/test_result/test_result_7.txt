**Summary**:
- Workspace 7-1 is a basic image processing application with fundamental features but lacks important error handling and security features
- Workspace 7-2 is a more complete implementation with database integration and additional features, but still has areas for improvement

**Key Differences**:
1. Architecture
   - 7-1: Basic implementation
   - 7-2: More sophisticated architecture with database integration

2. Features
   - 7-1: Basic image processing
   - 7-2: Advanced features (layers, presets)

3. State Management
   - 7-1: Basic state handling
   - 7-2: Better implementation with useReducer

4. API Design
   - 7-1: Basic endpoints
   - 7-2: Complete API with database integration

**Recommendations**:
1. For 7-1:
   - Add proper error handling and validation
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add security headers
   - Implement file cleanup
   - Add loading states and better error messages

2. For 7-2:
   - Add input validation
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add security headers
   - Implement file cleanup
   - Improve error handling and messages

This evaluation more objectively reflects the actual level of both projects, considering their respective strengths and weaknesses.
