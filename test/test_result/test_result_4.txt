**Summary**:
- Workspace_4-3 is a complete full-stack project with both frontend and backend implementations
- workspace_4-1 is essentially an empty project
- workspace_4-2 has a complete project structure but lacks implementation
- Workspace_4-3 scores higher than both as it provides actual working features

**Key Differences**:
1. Project Structure
   - 4-1: Minimal structure
   - 4-2: Well-organized, modular architecture
   - 4-3: Complete working implementation

2. Technology Stack
   - 4-1: No technology stack implemented
   - 4-2: Modern stack (React, Express, Sequelize, Redis)
   - 4-3: Modern stack (React, Flask, SQLAlchemy)

3. Development Readiness
   - 4-1: Not ready for development
   - 4-2: Ready for implementation with proper scaffolding
   - 4-3: Ready for development with working features

4. Production Readiness
   - 4-1: Far from production-ready
   - 4-2: Has basic production configurations but needs implementation
   - 4-3: Has working features but needs additional production configurations
